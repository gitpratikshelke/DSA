class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int count=0,n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]%2==1){// odd count
                count++;
                if(count==3){// three consecutive odds
                    return true;
                }
            }
            else{
                count=0;
            }

        }
        return false;
        
    }
